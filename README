This plugin introduces a command mode mappings (does not work in visual mode yet):

1. <Tab> (move right)
2. <Shift>+<Tab> (move left)

Depending on whether you are moving to the left or right, by doing it in a bisectional fashion, you're skipping half the content to the start or end of the line.

The feature is quite simplistic but saves a lot of time when you need to access content in the middle the current line over and over.
